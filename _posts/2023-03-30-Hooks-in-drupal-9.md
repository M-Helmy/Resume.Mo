## Hooks <br/>

Hooks in Drupal are like special tools that can help you change the way your website works. Imagine you have a toy car that can drive forward and backward,<br/> 
but you want to add a button to make it honk a horn.<br/> 
You can use a hook to add that button to your toy car!<br/>

In Drupal, hooks are little bits of code that you can add to your website to change how it looks or behaves. They allow you to add new features, modify existing ones, and even change the way Drupal itself works.<br/>

For example, let's say you want to change the way your website displays a certain type of content. You can use a hook to tell Drupal to use a different template or layout for that content.<br/>
Or, if you want to add a new field to a content type,<br/>
you can use a hook to create that field and add it to the content type.<br/>

Hooks are a powerful tool for developers, but they can also be a bit tricky to use.<br/> 
It's important to have a good understanding of how Drupal works and how to write code in PHP to use hooks effectively.<br/>
