## Why Headless Drupal <br/>

Making the site future proof. If in future there is a need to redesign a site, there wonâ€™t be any need of going through the hassle of redesigning the back-end and setting up services again. Since the logic of the website and the content management is handled by Drupal, redesigning a site visually would only require tinkering with the front-end.<br/>

It completely frees up the front-end team to work on the way the site looks, in-turn freeing up the back-end team to handle the siteâ€™s backend architecture.<br/>

It helps to speed up the site. JavaScript frameworks like React.js are known for their speed and ease of use. Using such framework to deliver content to the user eliminate a lot of the limitations of Drupalâ€™s own front-end architecture. Also, since these frameworks only have to deliver API calls from Drupal to HTML; the entire site gets faster since they need to adhere to complex logics set by Drupal and can only focus on content delivery itself.<br/>

The websites that use headless Drupal are much more responsive than ones using Drupalâ€™s native front-end. It has become almost a necessity for a site to be responsive due to the immense rise of mobile devices. Thanks to headless Drupal, this is well addressed.<br/>

**Conclusion:**<br/>
Headless Drupal (headless websites, for that matter) are all the rage now whenever the future of the web is discussed. Where CMSs aimed to simplify management of a websiteâ€™s content, this concept takes it a step further by aiming to simplify the front-end as well. Headless Drupal enables creating sites that are much faster, responsive and capable of delivering rich user experience.<br/>
